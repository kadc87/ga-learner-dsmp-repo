### Learnings from the project

 Building a logistic regression model while applying the following concepts.

 Checking outliers using the boxplot
 Checking correlation between the features using pairplot
 Create subplots with plots of target variables vs categorica variables using countplots
 Fit the Logistic Regression and calculate the Accuracy score
 Auc score and plot the ROC-AUC curve
 Roc auc plot
