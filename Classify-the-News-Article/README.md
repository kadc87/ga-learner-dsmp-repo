### Project Overview

 This dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. In total there are 422937 resources available in the dataset. The columns included in this dataset are:

    ID: the numeric ID of the article
    TITLE: the headline of the article
    URL: the URL of the article
    PUBLISHER: the publisher of the article
    CATEGORY: the category of the news item; one of: b:business, t:science and technology, e: entertainment and m:health
    STORY: alphanumeric ID of the news story that the article discusses
    HOSTNAME: hostname where the article was posted
    TIMESTAMP: approximate timestamp of the article's publication, given in Unix time (seconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970)

The goal is to predict which class a particular resource belongs to given the title of the resource. 


### Learnings from the project

 Solving it will reinforce the following concepts of text analytics:

    Preprocess text data with tokenization, stopword removal etc
    Vectorize data using Bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches
    Apply classifiers (Logistic and Multinomial Naive Bayes) to perform multi-class classification
